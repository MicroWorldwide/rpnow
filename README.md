# RPNow

RPNow is a self-hosted, web-based roleplay chat website.

(TODO: add a GIF here!)


# Running RPNow

**For non-technical users who just want to deploy a server, [there is a helpful guide here!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wN3TK5f2MDp9_q_U_8H2GknMNxxw8wX2Bk-0OMVbkGU/edit?usp=sharing)**

However, if you're interested in building the project from source, or modifying the server, read on.


## Build Requirements

* [Go 1.16+](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [Node 12+](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) (optional, but helpful for a pleasant development experience)


## Building

If you have GNU Make installed, then simply open a shell in the project root and run `make`.

Otherwise, you can execute the individual steps manually:

```sh
# Build the web frontend
cd views
npm install
npm run build

# Build the server
cd ../server
go build -o ../rpnow

# The built server executable will now be at the project root
cd ..
```


## Developing

For a fast and pleasant development experience, it's nice to be able to rebuild and reload the
server every time you change a source file. To do that for RPNow, run these two things:

* **Web Frontend:** Open a shell in the "views" directory. If you haven't already run `npm install`, do that first. Then, run `npm run watch`, which will watch and rebuild the JavaScript.
* **Server Backend:** Open a shell in the "server" directory. Make sure you have installed Nodemon (`npm install --global nodemon`) and then run `nodemon`. This will keep the server running at http://localhost:13000.


# State of the project

RPNow is more-or-less feature-complete. While it's possible that I may add features in the future, it is quite likely that the project will remain dormant for months or years.

If I become aware of any security issues, I will try to address them in a timely manner.
